One day, while I was at the gym, I took notice of a workout machine that seemed to be a mixture of an indoor cycling machine and a treadmill, to which they gave the name "Elliptical Machine", alluding to the trajectory of the pedals. The name sparked my curiosity and I decided to investigate why such a movement would be an ellipse.

Appearing to be a simple problem, I set up the most important geometric aspect of the machine into the following drawing:

The reference picture on the background was a random generic model I found on the [internet](https://www.mrmarketplace.com/elliptical-xc-140/) with dimensions measured in millimeters. The main point to consider is that the angle $\theta$ is sufficient to describe the entire dynamics of the system. This can be inferred by noticing that both segments $\bar{BZ}$ and $\bar{OA}$ span circles of radii $b$ and $r$ respectively. By fixing the angle $\theta$, the point $A$ stays fixed, and the segment $\bar{AZ}$ can only move along a circle of radius $a$, which intersect the circle of radius $b$ at two points, $Z$ and $F$. Since the segment $\bar{AZ}$ is not supposed to be all the way up there due to mechanical constraints of the machine and the fact that this would be very challenging for a person to accomplish (probably not very beneficial to their fitness either), we can discard this point and consider only the point $Z$.
